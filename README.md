## Link to Live Website

https://achris2.github.io/alex-portfolio/index.html

## Description 

This project is about getting started in developing a responsive portfolio website. 

It's a small start, but hopefully this is an evergreen project, as I further develop my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 


## Installation

No installation required. You will be able to access the website through the following link: 

https://achris2.github.io/alex-portfolio/index.html


## Usage 

Navigate using your browser, scroll over the images to see the Alt tags. 

You can see that if you click each of the links, they will take you to the corresponding section. 

I only really have one project live, with the others being place holders
